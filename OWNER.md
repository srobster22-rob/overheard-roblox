# OWNER.md — my direction for this project

The agent reads this file at the start of EVERY round (AGENT_LOOP.md, Stage 0).
Write in plain English. One item per line. Top item goes first.

## Next
<!-- e.g. "the lobby is boring" or "the monster never feels close" -->

## Never
<!-- standing constraints -->

## Done
<!-- the agent moves finished items here with the round number and result -->

- R4 � the Operator now forgets. Heat bleeds off in real time, so a phrase
  your group retires becomes safe to say again after about 40 seconds. It
  never did this before: once a phrase was burned it stayed burned for the
  life of the server. Also added a test that fails if a tuning dial is not
  actually read by the game (three of them were not).

- R5 - the second station (the breaker) is in, and the round's two lists were
  wired together. Before this, 4 servers in 10 ran the only objective for a
  concept the monster was not listening for: you could shout the jack number
  and nothing happened. Now the stations decide what it listens for.
  ONE THING FOR YOU: when a player joins mid-round, should the lines be
  re-dealt (holders reshuffled) or should whoever knows a number keep it?
  The code currently reshuffles. That is a design call, not a bug.
