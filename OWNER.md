# OWNER.md â€” my direction for this project

The agent reads this file at the start of EVERY round (AGENT_LOOP.md, Stage 0).
Write in plain English. One item per line. Top item goes first.

## Next
<!-- e.g. "the lobby is boring" or "the monster never feels close" -->

## Never
<!-- standing constraints -->

## Done
<!-- the agent moves finished items here with the round number and result -->

- R4 — the Operator now forgets. Heat bleeds off in real time, so a phrase
  your group retires becomes safe to say again after about 40 seconds. It
  never did this before: once a phrase was burned it stayed burned for the
  life of the server. Also added a test that fails if a tuning dial is not
  actually read by the game (three of them were not).
