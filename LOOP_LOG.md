# OVERHEARD — loop log

This file outranks every other doc in the repo. Work happens in numbered
rounds; each round appends an entry here. Read the last two entries before
starting anything.

## CHARTER

Build OVERHEARD: a co-op horror game where the monster hunts by understanding
the meaning of what players say, and learns their invented slang over time.
See `GAME.md` for the fiction and `RESEARCH.md` for platform limits.

## GATE — what "done" means for a round

A round is finished only when ALL of these hold:

1. `selene src` reports 0 errors and 0 warnings.
2. `lune run tests/lexicon` passes, and any new pure logic has a test there.
3. `rojo build default.project.json -o game.rbxlx` succeeds.
4. The change was exercised in a running Studio session (via MCP `run_code`, or
   a 2-player playtest if it touches replication) — not merely compiled.
5. An entry is appended below saying what changed, what was proven, and what
   the next round should pick up.

A round that cannot meet #4 says so explicitly in its entry rather than
claiming success.

## THE EXPANSION AXIS

The game grows along one axis: **new ways of understanding.** Every entity in
the roster is a different comprehension rule (`GAME.md` has the table). This is
what lets the loop run indefinitely without the game repeating itself — each
new listener re-teaches players a habit and then punishes it.

Backlog, roughly in order. Reorder freely; do not skip the gate.

- [ ] **R2** Objectives that force transfer. One real objective (the jack
      board): one player reads a number, another patches it, different rooms.
      Wire it to `Operator:credit` so success actually teaches the Operator.
- [ ] **R3** The Operator as a physical thing. Movement toward `payload`
      rooms on understanding. Sound before sight; silence is the tell.
- [ ] **R4** Speech-to-Text. Route voice through `AudioSpeechToText` into the
      same `Operator:hear` pipeline. MUST degrade to typed chat (see
      RESEARCH.md — voice needs verified 13+).
- [ ] **R5** LLM comprehension backend behind the existing
      `ComprehensionBackend` interface, A/B against the heuristic. Harden the
      prompt against injection; players WILL try to talk it out of character.
- [ ] **R6** The Lexicon persists across sessions (DataStore), per group.
      This is the retention mechanic, so it needs to be real, not cosmetic.
- [ ] **R7** Entity #4 The Supervisor — punishes silence. The first true
      inversion; the clip-generating one.
- [ ] **R8** Entity #7 The Translator — understands only figurative speech.
- [ ] **R9** Round flow: cutover, three objectives, the call, the escape.
- [ ] **R10** Being "connected" instead of dying — you become a voice your
      team can hear but cannot answer.

## R1 — foundation (2026-09-08)

**Built.** The fiction (`GAME.md`), platform constraints (`RESEARCH.md`), and
the working core of the mechanic:

- `shared/Lexicon` — pure text layer: tokenize, stem, n-grams, stopwords.
- `shared/Types` — shared vocabulary, including a `ComprehensionBackend`
  interface so the heuristic can be swapped for an LLM without touching callers.
- `server/systems/Heuristic` — comprehension that works today with no API
  access. Answers "did that convey a secret?" and "which unfamiliar words were
  used near it?"
- `server/systems/Operator` — the learning loop. Credits novel phrases to a
  concept only when the group *succeeds shortly after saying them*, weighted by
  recency. Acquisition is behavioural, not grammatical, which is why a player
  cannot dodge it just by being weird.
- `server/init.server` — TextChatService feeds every message to the Operator.
- `client/init.client` — the Lexicon panel: your coinages, white to amber to
  red as it closes in.

**Proven.** `lune run tests/lexicon` 14/14. `selene` clean. `rojo build` OK.

**NOT proven.** `TestOperator` (the acquisition assertions) has not been run —
it needs a Roblox runtime and MCP tools were registered but require a session
restart. **Round 2 must run it first** and treat any failure as the ticket.

**Next.** R2, and run TestOperator before anything else.
